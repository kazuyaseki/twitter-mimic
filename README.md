# Frontend Boilerplate

## Concept

- Linting by eslint, stylelint and flow
- Deploy gh-pages by CircleCI
- Run test(ava) in node
- Build for Chrome in development
- Build for IE11+ in production

## Stack

- Framework: react, redux, react-router
- Package manager: yarn
- transpiler: babel
- linter: eslint, flow, stylelint
- test runner: ava, enzyme
- coverage tools: istanbul, nyc
- builder: webpack
- css: postcss
- ci: circleci

## Development

```sh
# Run
yarn install
yarn start          # Start localhost:3355 with watch:js and watch:css

# Tasks
yarn watch     # Watch and build js for Chrome
yarn build     # Build js for Chrome
yarn build:production # Build js for IE11+
yarn lint       # eslint
yarn typecheck  # flow
yarn test       # Test in node
yarn test:cover # Test with coverage

yarn deploy # Deploy to github-pages
```

See package.json to learn others.

## Recommended tools
